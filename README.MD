## A revolutionary tool ##

The SV-7 is a small and lightweight handheld laser device, comprised of a 3d printed alluminium lower that serves as the device's heatsink and structure, as well as a pla cover that connects to it through a screwless assembly system.

Although it might look unasuming, it's tiny PCB is capable of providing up to 15w at a stable 5v with a single squeeze of it's pressure sensitive resistor


## Timeless design ##

The SV-7 might look simple at first glance, but a closer look will prove that it's anything but. The design's attention to detail is showcased in the contrast between the smooth, beveled white, and the sleek metallic lower

And at only 18mm thick, it can easily fit in most large pockets


## Powerful and flexible hardware ##

The device's heart and brains are all contained within a tiny and highly dense pcb, fitting snugly within the device and effortlessly combining the high power/frequency power circuitry (boost converter,charger,high current transistor) with a highly flexible attiny chip, taking away the burden of having to stuff multiple modules inside of the elegant case, and allowing you to simply connect all 3 components and modify the resistor's sensitivity/safety features to your liking.

And with a 1a tp4056 charging IC, you can quickly charge it's 18650 cell with ease

## Simple yet modular ##

The metal base can support a wide range of laser and lenses depending on your needs. Although designed for 9mm lasers, the design can easily be changed to suit lower power 5.6mm lasers.

It also sports a carefully designed heatsink, designed to wick away the massive amounts of excess heat a powerful diode can produce


## Affordable ##

**Metal chassis**: ~75$

**Top cover**: around 10 if you're having it printed online, otherwise <1$

**Populated PCB**: ~15$

**18650 battery** ~1.5$

**Collimating lens (optional):** ~1.99$ on aliexpress

**Trigger**: Simply follow the following tutorial https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Force-Sensitive-Resistor-FSR/

The device itself should only cost about 100 dollars, however your price heavily depends on the diode you are using. I reccomend the SHARP GH04C05Y9G, which can be had on aliexpress for only 38.99$

This puts the total at a surprisingly low 140$

## A wide range of applications ##

As this is essentialy just a handheld laser diode with a comfortable grip, it can be used in various fields and for countless purposes

- Military use
- Self defence
- Engineering
- Welding
- Mining
