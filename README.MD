## A revolutionary tool ##

The SV-7 is a small and ligthweight handheld laser device, comprised of a 3d printed alluminium lower that serves as the device's heatsink and structure, as well as a pla cover that connects to it through a screwless assembly system.

Although it might look unasuming, it's tiny PCB is capable of providing up to 15w at a stable 5v with a single squeeze of it's pressure sensitive resistor


## Timeless design ##

The SV-7 might look simple at first glance, but a closer look will prove that it's anything but. The design's attention to detail is showcased in the contrast between the smooth, beveled white, and the sleek metallic lower

And at only 18mm thick, it can easily fit in most large pockets


## Simple yet modular ##

The device's heart and brains are all contained within a tiny and highly dense pcb, fitting snugly within the device and effortlessly combining the high power/frequency power circuitry (boost converter,charger,high current transistor) with a highly flexible attiny chip, taking away the burden of having to stuff multiple modules inside of the elegant case, and allowing you to simply connect all 3 components and modify the resistor's sensitivity/safety features to your liking.

And with a 1a tp4056 charging IC, you can quickly charge it's 18650 cell with ease
